.. image:: _static/noodle.png
    :width: 40%

Noodle is the mascot of |project|. Noodle is a Nudibranch_, `Glaucus marginatus`_. Nudibranches are a group of amazing sea snails that shed their shells after the larval stage, to display an incredible array of forms, patterns and colours. `Glaucus marginatus`_ is a species found in the Pacific ocean, and often seen at beaches and in rock pools of the eastern Australian coast.
