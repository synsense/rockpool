    "# Audio Frontend for Xylo-A3 with AGC\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other notebook (in this folder), we investigated the simulation of modules in the frontend of Xylo-A3, consisting of the PDM microphone.\n",
    "This corresponds to the first signal path from the analog audio signal until the input of filterbank. We called this module PDM ADC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Xylo-A3, we have another signal path which starts from an ordinary microphone and consists of following modules:\n",
    "- ordinary microphone producing an analog signal\n",
    "- analog frontend consisting of fixed amplifier + anti-aliasing 1st order low-pass filter.\n",
    "- AGC (automatic gain controller) module consisting of\n",
    "  - PGA (programmable gain amplifier) whose gain can be adjusted in the range [1,30] with a 4-bit index control signal, which yields 16 possible gain levels.\n",
    "  - Equivalent ADC implamented in two steps to eliminate the aliasing noise as much as possible:\n",
    "    - high-rate ADC: to reduce anti-aliasing noise, the analog signal is sampled with 1, 2, or 4 times target audio sampling rate.\n",
    "    - anti-aliasing + decimation filter: the resulting high-rate signal is then low-pass filtered and decimated to obtain a 10-bit signal.\n",
    "  - AGC: output the equ-ADC is forwarded to an AGC module which measures the signal level and if it is low it sends control commands to PGA to increase the amplification gain. Also AGC makes sure that the signal amplification is reduces as soon as signal level goes up to avoid truncating the signal.\n",
    "  \n",
    "One can imagine the whole signal path from the output of the microphone until the output of the AGC and an AGC-ADC which quantizes the signal while adjusting its amplitude adaptively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this module is a 10-bit signal which is zero-padded by 4-bits to yield a 14-bit signal (the same as PDM-ADC), which is then forwarded to the filterbank module.\n",

    "We already investigated the remaining modules (filterbank + divisive normalization + spike generation) in the other notebook. \n",

    "In this notebook, we will focus on the AGC-ADC. The goal is to understand the general design principle behind AGC, its underlying modules, and also their key parameters. \n",

    "# How AGC was designed?\n",
    "In the following section, we explain various parts of AGC and how they should be implemented in hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to give an overview of the design and also clarify the role of various parameters in the Python implementation of each module.\n",

    "## Block diagram of AGC\n",
    "Fig.1. shows the block-diagram of AGC module consisting of the following parts:\n",
    "- `PGA (programmable gain amplifier)`: This gain of the amplifier can be controlled by the 4-bit command sent from `envelope controller` module. So using PGA we can have one of the following gains $g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{16}$. In our design, we set $g_1=1$ and $g_{16}=64$ giving a total maximum gain of 36 dB. \n",
    "- `ADC (anaolg to digital converter)`: this module takes the signal amplified with PGA and quantizes it into `num_bits = 10` bits. So the signed output can be in the range $-2^{\\text{num-bits - 1}} = -512, \\dots, 2^\\text{num-bits - 1}-1 = 511$. \n",
    "- `EC (envelope controller)`: This module observes the `num-bits=10` bit quantized signal from ADC and makes processings as we explain in a moment to decide if the gain needs to be increased or decreased and how it should happen. The output of this module is a 4-bit command that informs PGA and other modules of what is the best gain that should be selected for the next time steps.\n",
    "- `GS (gain smoother)`: One of the problems with AGC is that the PGA part has to be implemented in the analog domain. As a result, we cannot vary the desired gain very smoothly. In particular, when the gain changes from some $g_i$ to some $g_j$ the output undergoes a jump of size $\\frac{g_j}{g_i} - 1$. This sudden jump in gain may create transient effects in the filters in the filterbank following AGC. To solve this issue, we have added the gain smoother module, which makes sure that the gain transition from $g_i$ to $g_j$ happens smoothly in time so that the transient effect is not problematic.\n",

    "## EC Module\n",
    "EC (envelope controller) module is the main module doing the processing and deciding on the gain control. \n",
    "EC consists of the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. robust envelope detector (RED):** \n",
    "This module tracks how large the amplitude of the input signal is. The way RED is implemented is very similar to a diode-based enevlope circuit in the analog domain, with the difference that now we have implemented it in the digital domain. So it can be considered as some sort of fake-diode implementation ;) of this circuit in the digital domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, we could also implement this circuit in the analog domain, however, since we have a very low voltage power supplt $V_{cc}=1.1$ V, the activation voltage of the diode would have been an issue. Also in practice, we have more flexibility in choosing the parameters when we implement this circuit in the digital domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input $V_{in}$ to this circuit is the absolute value of the signal received from ADC. The output $V_{out}$ of this circuit is what we call the robust amplitude or envelope of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit works as follows:\n",
    "- Rising Regime: When $V_{in}$ is larger than $V_{out}$, the diode gets connected and the capacitor is charged with an equivalent recistor of $r \\parallel R$. Since $R \\gg r$, if the capacitor keeps charging it can reach a level of $\\frac{R}{R+r} V_{cc} \\approx V_{cc}$ as $R\\gg r$. The time-constant of charging in the rise regime is $\\tau_{rise} = (R \\parallel r) C$.\n",
    "- Falling Regime: When $V_{in}$ is less than $V_{out}$ namely the signal is falling from its peak value, the diode gets deactivated and the capacitor starts discharging with the equivalent resistor of $R$ which is much larger than $R \\parallel r$. As a result of this, in the fall mode the peak value of the signal obtained in the past preserved for much longer time. The time-constant of capacitor discharging in the falling regime is $\\tau_{fall} = R C$ where we have that $\\tau_{fall} \\gg \\tau_{rise}$. \n",

    "**Remark.** Note that in both falling and rising mode, the diode circuit is just a low-pass filter where the time-constant of the low-pass filter changes depending on if $V_{in} > V_{out}$ or vice versa.\n",

    "In this code, we have added a parameter `reliable_max_hystersis` which can range in the range $1 \\sim 2^\\text{num-bits - 1} - 1=511$. The reason we have added this is to create a hystersis such that the maximum registered envelope is not updated as soon as a sample slightly larger than the previous maximum envelope arrives, which typically happens when there is some noise in the signal. \n",

    "**3. waiting time scheduler (WTS):**\n",
    "After detecting the envelope and robust maximum with the previous module we need a simple `state-machine` that specifies how the gain-change commands should be sent to the PGA depending on the envelope of the signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we explain how to design this state machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1. enevlope levels:**\n",
    "Here we assume that we are working with a 10-bit ADC. For such an ADC, the estimated envelope by RED and its robuts maximum obtained through RPD lies in the range [0, 512]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our design, we use 4-bit commands from EC to PGA and because of that divide the envelope range into 16 levels: \n",
    "- $\\ell_1$ is the noise level and corresponds to weak signal that even after amplification by the first amplifier are quite weak.\n",
    "- $\\ell_{16}$ is the saturation level. Once the envelope (after amplification by PGA) passe from this level, extra care is needed to make sure that the PGA does not enter the saturation mode. As we will see, we will use extra care to make sure that once in this region, the PGA gain is adjusted immediately to go out of saturation mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark.** For an enevlope or max enevlope value $E$ in the range $[0, 512]$, we define the index of $E$ as the number of levels $\\{\\ell_i: i \\in [16]\\}$ that lie below $E$, namely, \n",
    "$$ind(E) = \\#\\{i \\in [16]: E\\geq \\ell_i\\}.$$\n",
    "For example, if envelope goes inside the saturation region, it will be above saturation level $\\ell_{16}$ and its index will be $16$. In contrast, if a signal is very weak and below the noise level $\\ell_1$, its index will be simply $0$. Also, if an enevlope of max enevlope $E$ is in the interval $(\\ell_i, \\ell_{i+1}]$, its index will be $ind(E) = i$.\n",

We use an exponential gain scaling such that $\\frac{g_{i+1}}{g_i} = \\alpha \\in (1, \\infty)$. So the gain values can be written as $g_{i} = \\alpha^{i-1}$. In practice, we will design the max enevelope levels $\\{\\ell_i: i \\in [16]\\}$ such that $\\ell_1 \\times g_{\\max} = \\ell_{16}$, namely, noise level after amplification approaches almost saturation level. \n",

    "It is well-known from signal processing that if we would like to sample a signal we should low-pass filter it to half sampling rate to avoid aliasing. \n",
    "In brief, aliasing happens because when we sample a sinusoid with frequency larger than half sampling rate, we obtain a sinusoid with a very low-frequency that falls within the passband of the signal.\n",
    "This implies that we need to eliminate those high-freq components to make sure that they do not create any interference on the desired signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current hardware implementation, we use a simple RC low-pass filter with cut-off frequency 20 KHz. Since the filter is not that selective, the high-frequency components (especially those close to 20KHz) are not\n",
    "attenuated enough. As a result, aliasing is still quite strong. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this issue, we implement ADC in two steps:\n",
    "- the input analog signal after low-pass filtering is first oversampled with a 1, 2, or 4 times target audio sampling rate. This yielda a high-rate digital signal.\n",
    "- this signal is then low-pass filtered with a sharp digital signal to eliminate the aliasing as much asss possible. The resulting signal is then decimated by the same factor 1, 2, 4 with which the signal was oversampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields a signal that has the same sampling rate as the target audio signal but a very low noise due to aliasing.\n",
    "The key idea behind this method is to replace the not-so-selective analog filter with a highly selective digital one. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "- in the current design we may have an ADC with an oversampling rate of $\\nu \\in \\{1,2,4\\}$. \n",
    "- For $\\nu=1$, we do not apply any filtering or decimation and forward the output of ADC to the output. \n",
    "- For $\\nu=2$ or $\\nu=4$, we process the output of the oversampled ADC with the anti-aliasing low-pass filter and then decimate it, where decimation simply means that we keep only one out of every $\\nu=2$ or $\\nu=4$ output samples at the output of the filter and forward it as the output of the equivalent ADC. As a result, the output of the equiavelnt ADC always has a sampling rate equal to the target audio sampling rate (around 50K in Xylo-A3).\n",

    "Suppose we sample the filtered signal $h(t) \\star x(t) = h(t) \\star s(t) + h(t) \\star z(t)$ with a sampling rate $f_s$. Since we assume that noise is white, one can show that the filtered CT (continuous time) noise has a power spectral density of $N_0 |H(f)|^2$. Therefore, the DT (discrete time) sampled noise has the auto-correlation function $A(t) = N_0 h(t) \\star h(-\n",

    "- aliasing only affects the correlation between noise samples. More specifically, if we fix the filter bandwidth $B$ and increase the sampling rate $f_s$, we start to take more dense samples in time. And as a result the noise samples become more and more correlated. This is also seen from the results we derived where we can see that for each $n$, $A[n] = \\mathbb{E}\\Big[\\tilde{z}[m] \\tilde{z}[m+n]\\Big]$ increase by increasing $f_s$, where we denoted the filtered noise by $\\tilde{z}(t) = h(t) \\star z(t)$ and $\\tilde{z}[n] = \\tilde{z}(nT_s)$. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Summary of noise analysis.**\n",
    "In brief, we can say that aliasing caused by varying/decreasing the sampling rate $f_s$ has no effect on noise variance, thus, SNR.

    "**Alising reduction by oversampling and decimation filtering.**\n",
    "In contrast with noise, which is independent of aliasing and is not affected by the signal sampling rate, increasing the signal sampling rate (oversampling) can be quite useful to eliminate the interference due to aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we assume that the input analog signal is filtered by the RC filter with the impulse response $h(t)$ and then oversampled by $f_s=\\nu F_s$ where $\\nu \\in \\{1,2,4\\}$ is the oversampling factor and where $F_s ~50K$ denotes the target audio sampling rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can process the oversampled signal with a digital filter and then downsample it by a factor $\\nu$ (namely we keep only even samples) to attenuate the aliasing even further. This is known as decimation low-pass filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we provide a simple solution using a light-weight decimator filter. We denote the impulse response of the digital decimation filter by $h[n]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Filter loss and issues\n",
    "There are several problems with using a decimation low-pass filter to build an equivalent ADC from an oversampled ADC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delay.** Filter introduces a delay in the signal proportional to the number of its taps/effective taps (in case of IIR filters). This can be problematic when we have also an AGC because it may happen that the signal amplitude has increased and AGC needs to lower the amplifier gain immediately to avoid distortion but the output of the equivalent ADC seen by AGC is still low such that AGC does not make any attempt to reduce the gain. To avoid this issue, we have to use a filter with very limited number of taps to keep the delay as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss in Dynamic Range/Number of Bits.** Filter takes some time to settle down during which the output of the filter may undergo a very lareg overshoot or undershoot compared with its amplitude during the steady-state regime. \n",
    "To be more specific, for a low-pass filter with taps $h[n]$, the DC gain of the filter is $G_{0}=\\sum h[n]$, which we may normalize to be $G_0=1$ to have a 0dB gain, whereas the maximum gain (amplitude amplification factor) at the output of the filter can be as large as $G_\\text{worst-case} = \\sum |h[n]|$, which happens for example for a binary-valued signal $x[n] = A\\ \\text{sign}(h[-n])$ where $\\text{sign}(.)$ denotes the sign function. \n",
    "This results in a loss in signal dynamic range by a factor\n",
    "$$\\text{loss} = \\frac{G_\\text{worst-case}}{G_0} =  \\frac{\\sum |h[n]|}{\\sum h[n]}.$$\n",
    "This is due to the fact that if we would like to avoid overflow or udnerflow in the filter, we have to attenuate the signal by $\\frac{G_\\text{worst-case}}{G_0}$ to make sure that it fits within the limited number of bits devoted to quantization in ADC. But then the highest filter gain (i.e., the 0-freq gain $G_0$ normalized to have a filter gain $G_0=1$ or 0dB) will be $\\frac{G_0}{G_\\text{worst-case}} < 1$. This results in an increase in the quantization loss, thus, loss in the equivalent ADC dynamic range. This loss would be as if with a 10-bit ADC we manage to extract less information bits from the signal, e.g., 9 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty in AGC Amplitude Adjustment.** Suppose we care about the worst-case scenario and attenuate the signal to avoid overflow and underflow in the filter. A major issue that may happen then is that the output of the ADC will never be rail-to-rail. So it would be difficult for AGC following ADC to detect if signal is in saturation mode. Note that this does not happen in ordinary ADC because as soon as signal amplitude becomes large and the amplifiers enter the saturation mode, ADC produces a very high-amplitude output, which is then used by AGC to lower-down the gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course in the design of AGC, we associate a large amplitude region to the saturation mode so this problem can be fixed but then due to shrinking the amplitude range, AGC will not be able to amplify the signal very efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our approach to reduce/avoid filter dynamic-range loss\n",
    "We can reduce the loss by not fully attenuating the signal according to the worst-case gain $G_\\text{worst-case} = \\sum |h[n]|$. For example, what we can do is to not attenuate the signal at all but then when the signal amplitude goes beyond the 10-bit ADC capacity range, we may truncate/clip it to fit it in 10 bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we avoid loss in dynamic range at the cost of some nonlinearity distortion due to clipping, which may be tolerable in almost all audio applications. In particular, in Xylo-A3 we are going to couple ADC with AGC (automatic gain controller) which will adjust and keep the signal amplitude much below the saturation region. So we expect that the nonlinearity distortion due to clipping be almost negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some more justification for this approach.** To justify this choice even more, we may mention that the worst-case filter gain happens only when the input signal is of the form $x[n] = A\\ \\text{sign}(h[-n])$, which has a wild variations between two extremes $+A$ and $-A$. Such wild signals typically never happen in practical signal processing scenarios. This may be another justification why we can relax design and focus on optimizing the dynamic range rather than focusing on the worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Microphone frequency response and other considerations in filter design\n",
    "Suppose we are working with an audio target frequency $B$ (e.g., $B=20$ KHz in Xylo-A3) and use a sampling rate $f_s = \\nu F_s$ where $F_s$ is the target audio sampling rate (e.g., around 50 KHz in Xylo-A3) and where $\\nu$ is the oversampling factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the frequencies above $\\frac{F_s}{2}$ cause aliasing effect and should be attenuated as much as possible. In practice, the most problematic components are the ones in the vicinity of $\\frac{F_s}{2}$ since higher frequency components are also attenuated by the microphone as the microphone has also a quite limited bandwidth. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that we need to design a filter that is almost flat in the range $[0,B]$ but has the sharpest transition in $[B, \\frac{F_s}{2}]$ to the stop band. A well-known class of FIR filters that have this feature are equiripple filters that can be designed using the well-known Parks-McClellan iterative method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did numerical simulations to illustrate this where we compared an ordinary FIR filter and an equiripple one of the same number of taps together. In these simulations we have also take into account the filtering effect of the RC circuit in the analog domain.\n",

    "- equiripple filter, however, has less attenuation beyond 40 KHz, however, these frequencies can indeed be attenuated by the microphone as well so should not be taken into account that much.\n",
    "- equiripple filter has more dynamic range loss than the other filter but since we do not attenuate the filter output and just apply clipping for high-amplitude outputs, this should be also file.\n",
    "- we take advantage of the ripple in the equiripple filter to avoid extra attenuation at 3dB frequency of the filter (which overlaps with 20 dB). Note that at this frequency we already have a 3dB attenuation due to RC filter implemented in the analog domain. But the other filter adds an additional loss and at the 3dB frequency we have 6 dB loss.\n",

    "\n",
    "- For example, from the simulations, it can be seen that the filter introduces huge loss in the passband and does not have enough attenuation in the stop-band or at least at half-the-sampling-rate of the audio, which is important for eliminating the aliasing effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast with the FIR filter we used in PDM microphone, here using FIR filter with large number of taps is very costly becuase the input signal is not 0-1 valued (as we had for the PDM bit-stream) and we cannot use the simple implementation (with no multiplier) we had for PDM case anymore. As a result, the number of multipliers grows with the number of filter taps, which would be difficult to afford in Xylo-A3. For example, we verified that we may need around 40 ~ 60 taps in order to get a good filter frequency response with enough aliasing attenuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these two reasons we decided to switch to IIR filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Design IIR filters\n",
    "As explained before, for simplicity of the implementation, we have to use IIR filters. We had already implemented IIR Butterworth filters in the filterbank but those filters are not useful here since we need a highly-selective filter that attenuates the aiasing as much as possible. Such selective filters were not needed in filterbankd becuase they may have introduced notch in frequency band between adjacent filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among all the class of IIR filters, **Elliptic** filters (which also belong to the class of equiripple filters) have the sharpest transition from the pass to the stop band which seems to be exactly what we need for eliminating the aliasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We evaluated several filters and with a simple filter of order 4, we were able to obtain an attenuation as low as -30 dB in the stop-band while keeping the whole passband [0, 20 KHz] almost flat.\n",
    "- Phase distortion is the biggest issue caused by IIR filters in signal processing problems. We checked the **phase response** of the filter within the target range [0, 20 KHz] and made sure that it remains almost linear so that phase and group delay distortion to the input audio are almost negligible.\n",
    "\n",

    "- in the filterbank we had the option to use more bits in case needed to capture the transient fluctuations of the filter in case there is any. These fluctuations then were averaged out and converted into the spikes. Here, however, we have to do all the processing and produce an output in the limited number of bits devoted to ADC. So, we may need to push the signal as much to its stationary limits as possible by adjusting the surplus amplification at the end and also clipping the amplitude of the signal which will mainly affect the transient section of the signal.\n",

    "## Effect of Gain Smoother\n",
    "By focusing at the plots at PGA gain transition times, we can see that the output of internal ADC undergoes jumps due to jumps in the gain of PGA at those points.\n",
    "However, gain smoother corrects these jumps and allows a smooth transition of signal at those points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more important at high signal amplitues and avoids introducing nonlinear distortion due to signal jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our design we make sure that the gain smoothing reaches its steady-state before the next gain change happens in PGA. \n",
    "The parameter that controls this is  `min_waiting_time`: the time constant of the gain smoothing filter is set to `min_waiting_time / 5`.\n",
