This allows to send an `num_timesteps` argument to the `evolve` method, which is consistent with other layer classes and important for the use within a `Network`. Besides, event though the hardware evolves in continuous time, the input events use discrete timesteps. These timesteps are $\\frac{10^{-7}}{9} \\text{ s} = 11.\\bar{1} \\cdot 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$ and mark the smallest value that can be chosen for the layer timestep `dt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the effect the timestep size has on computation time is much smaller than with other layers, it is not always advisable to choose the smallest possible value. The reason is that the number of timesteps between two input spikes is currently limited to $2^{16}-1 = 65535$. This means that with dt $= 11.\\overline{1} \\cdot 10^{-9} \\text{ s}$, any section in the  input signal without input spikes longer than about 0.73 milliseconds will cause the layer to throw an exception. Therefore it makes sense to set `dt` to something between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4}$ seconds, in order to allow for sufficiently long silent parts in the input while still maintaining a good temporal resolution.\n",
