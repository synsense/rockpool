    Time the execution of a callable

    Benchmark the creation and evolution of neuron layers

    A benchmark is defined as three functions :func:`prepare_fn`, :func:`create_fn`, :func:`evolve_fn`.
    :func:`prepare_fn` is called once per layer parameter set, to initialise the benchmark.
    It has the signature ``def prepare_fn(num_batches: int, num_timesteps: int, layer_size: int) -> object``.
    :func:`prepare_fn` may return an arbitrary python object ``bench_obj``, which is passed to the other benchmarking functions.
    :func:`prepare_fn` is not benchmarked, and can execute arbitrary code --- whatever is required to set up the benchmark.


    :func:`create_fn` is used to benchmark the creation of a neuron layer. It should do as little as possible, ideally just calling the layer creation constructor.
    It has the signature ``def create_fn(bench_obj: object) -> None``.
    :func:`create_fn` will be called many times as part of the benchmarking process.

    :func:`evolve_fn` is used to benchmark the evolution of the layer.
    It has the signature ``def evolve_fn(bench_obj: object) -> None``.
    :func:`evolve_fn` should do as little as possible besides evolve the layer.
    Random static data and layer creation should ideally be performed in :func:`prepare_fn` and passed as elements of ``bench_obj``.
    :func:`evolve_fn` will be called many times as part of the benchmarking process.

    :func:`.benchmark_neurons` will run these functions many times over increasing layer sizes.
    It will return lists of collected benchmark times (excluding warm-up) for layer construction and evolution, as well as a list of the layer sizes that were benchmarked: ``creation_times, evolution_times, layer_sizes``.

    You can conveniently plot the results of a benchmark with ``matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot(evolution_times, labels = layer_sizes)``.
    You can also use the convenience function :func:`plot_benchmark_results`.

    Arguments:
        prepare_fn (Callable): A callable which prepares a benchmark. Signature: ``def prepare_fn(num_batches: int, num_timesteps: int, layer_size: int) -> object``
        create_fn (Callable): A callable which creates a layer. Signature: ``def create_fn(bench_obj: object) -> None``
        evolve_fn (Callable): A callable which evolves a layer. Signature: ``def evolve_fn(bench_obj: object) -> None``
        benchmark_desc (str): A description of the benchmark, which will be returned
        layer_sizes (List[int]): A list of layer sizes which should be benchmarked. Default: ``[1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2000]``
        num_batches (int): The number of batches to test in evolution. Default: ``10``
        num_timesteps (int): The number of timesteps to test in evolution. Default: ``1000``
