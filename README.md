Rockpool is a Python package for developing signal processing applications with spiking neural networks. Rockpool allows you to build networks, simulate, train and test them, deploy them either in simulation or on event-driven neuromorphic compute hardware. Rockpool provides layers with a number of simulation backends, including Brian2, Torch, JAX, Numba and raw numpy. Rockpool is designed to make machine learning based on SNNs easier. It is not designed for detailed simulation of biological networks.

# Documentation and getting started

The best place to start with Rockpool is the [documentation](https://rockpool.ai), which contains tutorials and getting started guides.

The documentation is hosted online: [https://rockpool.ai/](https://rockpool.ai/), or can be built and hosted locally with Sphinx. Much of the documentation is available as Jupyter notebooks, to be used interactively.

# Installation instructions

Use `pip` to install Rockpool and required dependencies

```bash
$ pip install rockpool --user
```

The `--user` option installs the package only for the current user.

If you want to install all the extra dependencies required for Brian, PyTorch and Jax layers, use the command

```bash
$ pip install rockpool[all] --user
```

# License
